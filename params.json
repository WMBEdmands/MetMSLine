You can monitor progress by watching the new directories of results as the data is processed and the saving of all MetMSLine functions as it installs*\r\n\r\n**The function *Auto.MS.MS.match.R* is the only function not illustrated by the synthetic dataset as the data is simulated it is not possible to match random features to real MS/MS fragmentation data.**\r\n\r\n###Detailed Instructions\r\nFurther more detailed instructions of usage of each function and output can be found on our GitHub wiki pages https://github.com/WMBEdmands/MetMSLine/wiki\r\n\r\n### Author\r\nWilliam MB Edmands (@WMBEdmands)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
