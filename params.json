{"name":"MetMSLine","tagline":"R functions for automation of biomarker discovery based on processing downstream of large LC-MS datasets from any peak picking software ","body":"Getting Started: MetMSLine Instructions\r\n==============\r\n###Purpose\r\nMetMSLine and associated software functions were created in the R language to attempt to achieve improved standard operating procedures and good laboratory practice for efficient and objective untargeted metabolomics analysis of large-scale (e.g. >300  samples) high-resolution LC-MS datasets.\r\n \r\nYou will need to install the latest version of R (available here: [R.download.page](http://www.r-project.org/)) and also following R installation RStudio is recommended for its user-friendly interface (available here: [Rstudio](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop))\r\n\r\n###Required packages\r\n\r\n-Initially install all R package dependencies by typing or pasting these lines of code into the command line of the R or RStudio console, you will only need to do this once per computer operating system:\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\ninstall.packages(c(\"fgui\",\"tcltk2\",\"zoo\", \"gplots\", \"ggplot2\", \"sfsmisc\", \"RColorBrewer\", \"readMzXmlData\"))\r\nsource(\"http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R\")\r\nbiocLite(\"pcaMethods\")\r\n```\r\n###What does it do?\r\nMetMSLine is compatible with any peak picking software output (e.g. XCMS, mzMine and proprietary softwares) and is available as both a user friendly graphical user interface for non R specialists and also as command line functions for seamless integration. It is possible to use MetMSLine on any operating system.\r\n\r\nSimply download the .zip file in the top right corner of this page, extract and save the files within a local directory on your computer (e.g. D:/MetMSLine).\r\n\r\nIn order to commence the MetMSLine processing sequence with a GUI simply type the following example commands into your R or RStudio (recommended) console \r\ne.g.\r\n```{r}\r\nsource('D:/MetMSLine/PreProc.QC.RLSC.GUI.R')\r\n###This will start the MetMSLine GUI for pre-processing.###\r\n```\r\nFollowing pre-processing type/paste the following commands in this sequence to continue the data processing sequence.\r\n```{r}\r\nsource('D:/MetMSLine/Auto.PCA.GUI.R')\r\nsource('D:/MetMSLine/Auto.MV.Regress.GUI.R')\r\nsource('D:/MetMSLine/Auto.MS.MS.match.GUI.R')\r\nsource('D:/MetMSLine/DBAnnotate.GUI.R')\r\n```\r\nThe MetMSLine installation also includes synthetic high resolution LC-MS data (5000 MS features, 80 samples, 20 Quality Controls) and synthetic continuous Y-variable data (10 Y-variables) with default settings.\r\n\r\n###Detailed Instructions\r\nFurther more detailed instructions of usage of each function and output can be found on our GitHub wiki pages https://github.com/WMBEdmands/MetMSLine/wiki\r\n\r\n### Author\r\nWilliam MB Edmands (@WMBEdmands)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
