\title{preProc - combined pre-processing steps of the MetMSLine package.}
\usage{
preProc(peakTable = NULL, obsNames = NULL, sampNames = NULL,
  qcNames = NULL, blankNames = NULL, zeroFillValue = NULL,
  cvThresh = NULL, nCores = NULL, baseLogT = exp(1),
  blankFCmethod = "mean", blankFCthresh = 2, normMethod = "medFC")
}
\arguments{
\item{peakTable}{either a data.frame, full file path as a character string to a  .csv file of a peak table in the form observation (samples) in columns and
variables (Mass spectral signals) in rows. If argument is not supplied a GUI file selection window will open and a .csv file can be selected.}

\item{obsNames}{character vector of observation (i.e. sample/ QC/ Blank) names to identify appropriate observation (sample) columns.}

\item{sampNames}{character vector of sample names to identify appropriate observation (sample) columns. If 
either the sampNames or qcNames arguments are not supplied then the pooled QC
 \code{\link{loessSmooth}} function is not performed.}

\item{qcNames}{character vector of quality control (QC) names to identify appropriate observation (quality control) columns. If the qcNames argument is not supplied neither the \code{\link{loessSmooth}} 
or \code{\link{cvCalc}} functions will be carried out.}

\item{blankNames}{character vector of blank (i.e. negative control) names to identify
appropriate observation (blank) columns. If this and the sampNames argument are supplied the preProc function 
will conduct a background subtraction (samples:blanks). This is carried
out by calculating the fold change (either mean or median: see blankFCmethod) between the samples
(see sampNames argument) as the numerator and the blanks as the denominator for each LC-MS feature. 
Any LC-MS features lower than the fold change threshold (blankFCthresh) will be removed. 
The fold change threshold can be set as required (default = 2, see blankFCthresh).}

\item{zeroFillValue}{numeric value to fill zero/ missing values (NA). By default
half the mimimum non-zero observed peak intensity is used.}

\item{cvThresh}{numeric numeric the minimum CV\% to retain an LC-MS variable (default = NULL).
If this argument and qcNames are not supplied the CV\% will not be calculated 
using the quality control samples and no LC-MS features below the CV\% 
threshold will not be removed.}

\item{baseLogT}{the base with respect to which logarithms are computed \code{\link{log}}. Defaults to e=exp(1)}

\item{blankFCmethod}{character either 'median' or 'mean' fold change calculation.}

\item{blankFCthresh}{numeric sample:blank fold change cut-off. Any LC-MS
features below this threshold will be removed.}

\item{normMethod}{either "medFC" for median fold change or "totIon" for total ion signal normalization.
also a custom vector of factors equal in length to the obsNames argument with 
which to normalize the data can also be supplied. default = "medFC".}
}
\value{
a data frame identical to peakTable argument (with potentially fewer
rows/ LC-MS features if blank substraction or CV\% calculation/ threshold filtration 
have been performed, see: \code{\link{blankSub}}, \code{\link{cvCalc}}).
}
\description{
Wrapper function performs all multiparametric preprocessing steps 
for large-scale high-resolution LC-MS metabolomic datasets. Combines the 
\code{\link{zeroFill}},  \code{\link{signNorm}}, \code{\link{loessSmooth}},
\code{\link{blankSub}}, \code{\link{cvCalc}} and \code{\link{logTrans}} 
functions.
}
\details{
the wrapper function performs the following steps of partially optional
data pre-processing steps, not supplying certain function arguments affects which
preprocessing steps will be conducted:

1. zero filling (see: \code{\link{zeroFill}} for further details).

2. signal normalization (optional, see: \code{\link{signalNorm}} for further details).

3. pooled QC-based loess smoothing (optional, see: \code{\link{loessSmooth}} for further details).

4. blank substraction (see: \code{\link{blankSub}} for further details).

5. Coefficient of variation calculation and filtration 
(optional, see: \code{\link{cvCalc}} for further details).

6. log transformation (see: \code{\link{logTrans}} for further details).
